NAME
    oss - Operating System Simulator: a unix/linux application used for simulating simple OS behavior.
SYNOPSIS
    oss [-fv] [-f<logfile> -v]
DESCRIPTION
    Simulates a process scheduler by generating up to 100 child processes, and handling the states they report back to OSS.
    OSS logs its actions in a file

    Options:
        -f  optional: write the parent(oss) process output to a log file.  if no value is provided, the default log will be
            oss.log, and will be stored in the root of the oss execution directory.  Default and given log names will be
            cleared on each execution.
        -v  optional: provides additional operation details to the console and output log.

EXAMPLES
 oss                    => Simulated resource management operations take place. OSS will output its events to the oss.log file.
 oss -f logproc.log     => Simulated resource management operations take place. OSS will output its events to the logproc.log file.
 oss -v                 => Simulated resource management operations take place. OSS will output additional event
                           information to the oss.log file.
 oss -f logproc.log -v  => Simulated resource management operations take place. OSS will output its event information
                           to the logproc.log file.
