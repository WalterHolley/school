NAME
    oss - Operating System Simulator: a unix/linux application used for simulating simple OS behavior.
SYNOPSIS
    oss [-f] [-f<logfile>]
DESCRIPTION
    Simulates memory access by generating child processes, and handling the memory access requests they report back to OSS.
    OSS logs its actions in a file

    Options:
        -f  optional: write the parent(oss) process output to a log file.  if no value is provided, the default log will be
            oss.log, and will be stored in the root of the oss execution directory.  Default and given log names will be
            cleared on each execution.

EXAMPLES
 oss                    => Simulated memory access operations take place. OSS will output its events to the oss.log file.
 oss -f logproc.log     => Simulated memory access operations take place. OSS will output its events to the logproc.log file.
