NAME
    oss - Operating System Simulator: a unix/linux application used for simulating simple OS behavior.
SYNOPSIS
    oss [-nst] [-n <num> -s <num> -t <num> -f<logfile>]
DESCRIPTION
    Executes a series of child processes for up to 60 simulated seconds.  OS clock is simulated by the
    parent process, and observed by the child processes via message queue.

    Options:
        -n  required: the number of child worker processes to be created by oss.  Range from 0 - 18(inclusive).
            0 = no workers will be started.
        -s  required: the max number of child worker processes to be executed concurrently. 0 = system maximum(18).
        -t  required: the maximum number of seconds each child worker process will run before terminating. Minimum value of
            1 second is allowed.  Runtime is randomly determined between zero(exclusive) and the provided value(inclusive).
        -f  optional: write the parent(oss) process output to a log file.  if no value is provided, the default log will be
            oss.log, and will be stored in the root of the oss execution directory.  Default and given log names will be
            cleared on each execution.

EXAMPLES
    oss -n 3 -s 0 -t 2  => 3 workers will be executed, all workers will be executed concurrently, each worker
                           can potentially exist for a max of 2 seconds before terminating. oss output will go to
                           oss.log
    oss -n 4 -s 2 -t 4 -f logproc.log  => 4 workers will be executed, up to two workers will be executed
                            concurrently, each worker can potentially exist for a max of 4 seconds before
                            terminating.  oss output will write to logproc.log
