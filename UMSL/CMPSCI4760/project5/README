PROJECT 5: OS Resource Management Simulator written in C.
A simulated Operating System clock will be managed by a parent process(oss).
At random intervals, oss will start a worker processes, and communicate back
and forth with these processes through a pair of message queues.  The worker processes
will make requests for resource from oss.  Depending on the availability of resources, oss
will grant the request, or detect a deadlock if the system has none of the requested resource available.
oss will then decide to terminate a process based on its priority level if it's using the requested resource.

Installation
run 'make' command

Invocation
oss [-f <logfile>]
For additional information on application use, use the help(oss -h) command

EXAMPLE OUTPUT
command: oss -f ossproc.log (executes three worker processes, all simultaneously, each process will run for a maximum of 2 seconds, and the oss parent output
will be written to the ossproc.log file)
