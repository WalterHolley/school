PROJECT 2: Parent/Child Process Management in C with simulated Operating System clock
A parent command line application(oss) takes in parameters that are used to facilitate a series
of child processes(worker) through their execution.

Installation
run 'make' command

Invocation
oss [-n <num> -s <num> -t <num>]
For additional information on application use, use the help(oss -h) command

EXAMPLE OUTPUT
command: oss -n 3 -s 0 -t 2 (executes three worker processes, all simultaneously, each process will run for a maximum of 2 seconds)
The oss application will create child processes that executes the following command: ./worker <seconds> <nanoseconds>
Every half-second, a process table will display with current process information.  The worker processes will also display
status information every second, until they reach their termination time, or are terminated early by the oss process.
Output similar to what's below will occur:
WORKER PID:19024 PPID:19012 Iteration:1 before sleeping
WORKER PID:19024 PPID:19012 Iteration:1 after sleeping
WORKER PID:19024 PPID:19012 Iteration:2 before sleeping
WORKER PID:19024 PPID:19012 Iteration:2 after sleeping
