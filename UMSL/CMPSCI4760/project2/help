NAME
    oss - Operating System Simulator: a unix/linux application used for simulating simple OS behavior.
SYNOPSIS
    oss [-nst] [-n <num> -s <num> -t <num>]
DESCRIPTION
    All commands with corresponding parameters are required. The number used for each parameter must
    range from 0 - 18(inclusive), otherwise an error will be thrown.

    Options:
        -n  required: the number of child worker processes to be created by oss.  Range from 0 - 18(inclusive).
            0 = no workers will be started.
        -s  required: the max number of child worker processes to be executed concurrently. 0 = no maximum.
        -t  required: the maximum number of seconds each child worker process will run before terminating. Minimum value of
            1 second is allowed.  Runtime is randomly determined between zero(exclusive) and the provided value(inclusive).

EXAMPLES
    oss -n 3 -s 0 -t 2  => 3 workers will be executed, all workers will be executed concurrently, each worker
                           can potentially exist for a max of 2 seconds before terminating.
    oss -n 4 -s 2 -t 4  => 4 workers will be executed, up to two workers will be executed concurrently, each
                           worker can potentially exist for a max of 4 seconds before terminating.
