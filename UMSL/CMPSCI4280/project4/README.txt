Project 4: Code Generation
Takes in a file, and analyzes its contents, separating the individual file tokens,
parses the file into a tree structure, generates the static semantics for the document,
and outputs a file containing code that can be used to work with the ASM interpreter
used by Univ. Of Missouri.
