//***********REFLECTIONS***********//
/*
This particular project was fairly straightforward.  I used the experience from the previous programming class and just
dove right in.  Escape sequences are similar between different programming languages, so I didn't have to look up anything.
This assignment took maybe 5 minutes or so to finish.  I didn't require any help, save for a little reading in the book to get
print statement for Java.  The best part of this assignment was that it was fairly short and sweet!  Just a few lines of code to write,
and I could move on to the next task.  the best part of this Exercise was just seeing the proper end result.
